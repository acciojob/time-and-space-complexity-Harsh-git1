	<h1> Concepts of Time Complexity and Space Complexity</h1>
	<p>  the Time Complexity is the computational complexity that describes the amount of computer time it takes to run an algorithm. By considering time complexity while code we can make code more efficient. </p>
	<p> The <b>Space Complexity</b> of an algorithm is the total space taken by the algorithm with respect to the input size. Suppose a program takes at worst case n space then it space complexity will be denoted as O(n) </p>
